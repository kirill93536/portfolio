## Escape the House

*The first big project I completed, reaching a demo version state with several playable levels.*

### Description

**Escape the House** is a horror game where the player is trapped in an abandoned house and must navigate through 8 levels to escape. Each level presents a unique challenge that tests the player's memory and observation skills.

### Gameplay Mechanics

- **Random Room Selection**: Each level randomly selects a room from a pool of available rooms, enhancing replayability.
- **Observation Phase**: Players have ample time to observe and memorize the details of the room before the lights go out.
- **Anomalies Detection**: After the lights turn back on, anomalies appear in two out of three rooms. Anomalies include object movement, disappearance, shrinkage, distortion, and other changes.
- **Sanity and Curse Mechanics**: 
  - **Sanity Bar**: Depletes over time, representing the player's mental state.
  - **Curse Bar**: Fills up when sanity reaches zero, leading to hallucinations and visual effects that increase the game's difficulty.
- **Decision Making**: Players must choose the safe room without anomalies to progress. Selecting the wrong corridor or depleting the curse bar results in game over.

### Features

- **Immersive Horror Experience**: Atmospheric design and mechanics that create tension and suspense.
- **Dynamic Difficulty**: The sanity and curse mechanics add layers of challenge, requiring quick thinking and keen observation.
- **Starting Room Hub**: Acts as the central point where players start and return upon death, complete with tutorial boards and game rules.

## Throw & Paint

*A simple yet engaging project developed as part of an application for a Unity Junior position.*

### Description

**Throw & Paint** is a game where players interact with a rotating platform by throwing objects and paint cans. The game features two modes that offer different interactive experiences.
