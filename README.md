## Escape the House

*The first big project I completed, reaching a demo version state with several playable levels.*

### Description

**Escape the House** is a horror game where the player is trapped in an abandoned house and must navigate through 8 levels to escape. Each level presents a unique challenge that tests the player's memory and observation skills.

### Gameplay Mechanics

- **Random Room Selection**: Each level randomly selects a room from a pool of available rooms, enhancing replayability.
- **Observation Phase**: Players have ample time to observe and memorize the details of the room before the lights go out.
- **Anomalies Detection**: After the lights turn back on, anomalies appear in two out of three rooms. Anomalies include object movement, disappearance, shrinkage, distortion, and other changes.
- **Sanity and Curse Mechanics**: 
  - **Sanity Bar**: Depletes over time, representing the player's mental state.
  - **Curse Bar**: Fills up when sanity reaches zero, leading to hallucinations and visual effects that increase the game's difficulty.
- **Decision Making**: Players must choose the safe room without anomalies to progress. Selecting the wrong corridor or depleting the curse bar results in game over.

### Features

- **Immersive Horror Experience**: Atmospheric design and mechanics that create tension and suspense.
- **Dynamic Difficulty**: The sanity and curse mechanics add layers of challenge, requiring quick thinking and keen observation.
- **Starting Room Hub**: Acts as the central point where players start and return upon death, complete with tutorial boards and game rules.

In this project, I developed a roguelike game featuring room-based procedural level generation. The game emphasizes exploration, combat, and resource management as players navigate through randomly generated rooms filled with enemies.

### Gameplay Mechanics

- **Procedural Level Generation**: Customizable level generator with settings for different room setups, ensuring unique playthroughs.
- **Combat System**: Players can pick up and drop weapons, engaging enemies with shooting mechanics.
- **Enemy Encounters**: Each room, except the starting and final rooms, contains enemies that must be defeated to progress.
- **Randomized Enemy Spawns**: Enemy types and quantities are randomized in each room, adding unpredictability to the gameplay.

### Features

- **Customizable Generator**: Allows for varied level designs and increased replay value.
- **Weapon Mechanics**: Provides players with choices in combat, enhancing the strategic aspect of the game.
- **Progression System**: Players must clear rooms to find the escape portal, creating a sense of progression and achievement.

## Throw & Paint

*A simple yet engaging project developed as part of an application for a Unity Junior position.*

### Description

**Throw & Paint** is a game where players interact with a rotating platform by throwing objects and paint cans. The game features two modes that offer different interactive experiences.

### Gameplay Mechanics

- **Mode Switching**: Players can switch between two modes using a button at the bottom of the screen.
  - **Object Throwing Mode**: Players throw objects onto the rotating platform, causing them to stick upon collision.
  - **Painting Mode**: Players have six paint colors to choose from and can throw paint cans. When a paint can collides with a glued object, it changes the object's color accordingly.

### Features

- **Interactive Platform**: The rotating platform adds a dynamic element to the gameplay.
- **Creative Expression**: Allows players to create visually appealing designs by combining objects and colors.
- **Simple Controls**: Easy-to-use mechanics make the game accessible and enjoyable.

## TD Infitode 2 Clone

*An attempt to create a clone of "Infitode 2," focusing on tower defense mechanics and level management.*

### Description

In this unfinished project, I worked on replicating the core mechanics of "Infitode 2." Although the project was not completed, it includes several key features typical of tower defense games.

### Gameplay Mechanics

- **Level Manager with Waypoints**: Implemented a system for enemy movement along predefined paths.
- **Tower Placement**: Players can place towers strategically to defend against enemies.
- **Tower Animations**: Added visual feedback for tower actions and states.

## Simple Maze

*A mini-game developed as part of a one-hour challenge to create a game from scratch.*

### Description

In **Simple Maze**, players navigate through a maze to find a key and three levers to disable traps. The game was developed within an hour, focusing on quick development and implementation.

### Gameplay Mechanics

- **Maze Navigation**: Players must find their way through the maze to locate the key and levers.
- **Trap Mechanics**: Traps are present that the player must disable by finding levers.
- **Time Challenge**: The game was created under time constraints, leading to a basic implementation.

### Features

- **Rapid Prototyping**: Demonstrates the ability to develop a functional game within a limited timeframe.
- **Basic Puzzle Elements**: Incorporates key game design principles like item collection and obstacle avoidance.
